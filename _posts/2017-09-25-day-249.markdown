1/ **Bill Cassidy and Lindsey Graham revised their health care proposal to include more funding to Alaska, Arizona, Kentucky, and Maine**, the home states of Lisa Murkowski, John McCain, Rand Paul, and Susan Collins. All have either opposed or been reluctant to support the bill. Rand Paul reiterated his opposition to the revised health care bill. Collins said she was all but certain to oppose the proposal. On Friday, [McCain came out against](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/22/us/politics/mccain-graham-cassidy-health-care.html) the earlier form of the bill. Murkowski, who voted against the previous repeal bill in July, hasn't announced her position. Ted Cruz said he doesn’t support the bill and suggested that Mike Lee also opposes it. A vote must occur this week before protections against a Democratic filibuster expire. “No” votes from three of the 52 GOP senators would kill the bill.
